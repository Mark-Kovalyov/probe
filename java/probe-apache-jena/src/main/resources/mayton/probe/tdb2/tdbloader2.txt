tdbloader2 - TDB Bulk Loader

Usage: tdbloader2 --loc <Directory> [Options] <Data> ...

Bulk loader for TDB which manipulates the data files directly and so
can only be used to create new databases.  This command relies on
POSIX utilities so will only work on POSIX operating systems.

If you wish to bulk load to an existing database please use tdbloader
instead.

Required options are as follows:

  -l <DatabaseDirectory>
  --loc <DatabaseDirectory>
    Sets the location in which the database should be created.

    This location must be a directory and must be empty, if a
    non-existent path is specified it will be created as a new
    directory.

  <Data>
    Specifies the path to one/more data files to load

Common additional options are as follows:

  -h
  --help
    Prints this help summary and exits

Advanced additional options are as follows:

  -d
  --debug
    Enable debug mode, adds extra debug output

  -j <JvmArgs>
  --jvm-args <JvmArgs>
    Sets the arguments that should be passed to the JVM for the
    JVM based portions of the build.

    Generally it is best to not change these unless you have been
    specifically advised to.  The scripts will use appropriate
    defaults if this is not specified.

    In particular be careful increasing the heap size since many
    parts of TDB actually use memory mapped files that live
    outside the heap so if the heap is too large the heap may
    conflict with the memory mapped files for memory space.

  -k
  --keep-work
    Keeps the temporary work files around after they are no longer
    needed.  May be useful for debugging.

  -p <Phase>
  --phase <Phase>
    Sets the phase of the build to run, supported values are:

      all      Full bulk load
      data     Data phase only
      index    Index phase only, requires the data phase to
               previously have been run

    When no phase is specified it defaults to all

  -s <SortArgs>
  --sort-args <SortArgs>
    Sets the arguments that should be passed to sort for the sort
    based portions of the build.

    Generally it is best not to change these as the scripts will
    use appropriate defaults for your system.

  -t
  --trace
    Enable trace mode, essentially sets -x within the scripts
